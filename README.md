# UnityConsumables
A Unity 2022.3.21f1 project for inventory with consumable items. Created with mind of full code abstraction.

### How to play?
Use Pause button in right top corner and select something from Inventory then press Use button. The item should invoke its effect.

For the example sake, there are only two items in Inventory - Beer (adds VFX based on Unity Shader Graph for 3 seconds), Medicine (displays "healing player" message in Console).
You can at any time close Pause to inspect the background.


### Third-party Assets
- Used Stick Nightmare Demo as reference for drunk effect and placeholder background: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdn8-btmdjE
